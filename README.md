This is a simple react app, showcasing the use of backend knowledge using python and flask, along with CORS. This also is another react app but is more of a learning process rather than an actual self-made project.

## How to run it
### In one terminal
Go to backend folder and run 'venv\Scripts\activate' to activate virtual environment
Then run 'python server.py'

### In a second terminal while you have that run
Go to frontend folder and run 'npm install'
Then once finished, press 'npm start' and you are a go!
